# SuperMarket-marketing-strategy.
A Supermarket is planning for the year end sale - they want to launch a new offer i.e. gold membership for only USD499 that is of USD999 on normal days(that gives 20% discount on all purchases) only for existing customers, for that they need to do a campaign through phone calls - best way to reduce the cost of campaign is to make a predictive model to classify customers who might purchase the offer, using the data they gathered during last year campaign. We will build a model for classifying whether customers will reply back with a positive response or not.
What are the different factors which affect the customer Response(Target variable).
What business recommendations can we give based on the analysis?
